        What it does:

        Declares a public method named Get that handles HTTP GET requests.
        Returns the list of all students.
        The return type ActionResult<IEnumerable<Student>> allows returning either the list or an HTTP error response if needed.
        
        Syntaxes and conventions used:

        Method Declaration
        public makes the method accessible outside the class.
        The method name Get follows RESTful naming conventions for retrieving resources.
        
        Return Type
        ActionResult<IEnumerable<Student>> is a generic type that can return a collection of Student objects or an HTTP response.
        
        Expression-bodied Member (=>)
        Uses the => syntax for concise method implementation, returning students directly.
        
        Generic Collection (IEnumerable<Student>)
        Uses IEnumerable<Student> to represent a collection of students.
        
        Camel Case Naming
        Variable and property names use camel case (students, Student).

                If the list is empty, it sets the new student's ID to 1.
            In short: it auto-generates a new, incremented StudentId for each new student.

            Ternary Operator (? :)
                Syntax: condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false
                Example: students.Count > 0 ? ... : ...
                It checks if there are any students. If true, it does one thing; if false, another.
            
            Lambda Expression (s => s.StudentId)
                Syntax: (parameter) => expression
                Example: students.Max(s => s.StudentId)
                Used to select the StudentId property from each student in the list.
                
            Method Call (Max)
                Syntax: collection.Method(lambda)
                Example: students.Max(s => s.StudentId)
                Finds the maximum StudentId in the list.
            
            Assignment (=)

                Syntax: variable = value
                Example: student.StudentId = ...
                Assigns the calculated value to StudentId.
            
            Arithmetic (+ 1)
                Adds 1 to the maximum ID to generate the next ID.
            
            Property Access (students.Count, student.StudentId)
                Accesses properties of objects.

            Method Call
            CreatedAtAction(...) is a method that creates a 201 Created HTTP response.
            
            nameof Operator
            nameof(Get) gets the string name "Get" of the method, making code refactoring-safe.
            
            Anonymous Object
            new { id = student.StudentId } creates an object with a property id for route values.
            
            Object Property Access
            student.StudentId accesses the StudentId property of the student object.
            
            Passing Multiple Arguments
            The method takes three arguments: the action name, route values, and the response body.
            
            Camel Case Naming
            Properties and variables use camel case (student.StudentId, id).

        What it does:

        Handles HTTP POST requests to add a new student.
        Receives a Student object from the request body.
        Assigns a unique StudentId to the new student.
        Adds the student to the in-memory students list.
        Returns a 201 Created response with the new student's details and a location header pointing to the GET endpoint for that student.
        Under the hood:

        The framework binds the incoming JSON data to the Student parameter.
        The method calculates the next available StudentId.
        The student is added to the static list, which acts as a temporary database.
        The method returns a response using CreatedAtAction, which:
        Sets the HTTP status code to 201 (Created).
        Includes the new student data in the response body.
        Sets the Location header to the URL where the new student can be retrieved.
        Summary:
        This method creates and stores a new student, then responds with all the details and a link to access that student via the API.

/*
Difference between ActionResult and IActionResult:

IActionResult
An interface representing any possible HTTP response (e.g., Ok, NotFound, BadRequest).
Use when you want to return only status codes or responses, not strongly-typed data.
Example:
public IActionResult Delete(int id)
{
    // returns NoContent(), NotFound(), etc.
}

ActionResult<T>
A generic class that can return either a strongly-typed object (T) or any IActionResult response.
Use when you want to return data (like a model) or an error/status response.
Example:
public ActionResult<Student> Get(int id)
{
    // returns a Student object or NotFound()
}

Syntax/Conventions:
Use IActionResult for actions that only return status codes (no data).
Use ActionResult<T> for actions that may return data or status codes.
Both are commonly used in ASP.NET Core controllers for flexibility and clarity.

Summary:
IActionResult: for any response.
ActionResult<T>: for data or any response.
Choose based on whether your endpoint returns data or just status.
